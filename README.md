These programs will not immediately work for any channel. You must first find an oauth key
it will look something like "oauth:##################". To run the visual files, rename
them "index.html" then drag them into browser and change the url to 
"http://localhost/7777"
to start the community canvas a moderator must type "~resetboard"
